I love this time of night.
* [Why's that?]
    The crickets have just gone to sleep.
    -> sit_down
* [It is beautiful out]
    Yea
    -> sit_down
* [I think it's kinda creepy...]
    What exactly are you scared of?
    -> sit_down

== sit_down ==
You seem fresh. 
Your beat's just begun, I take it. 
And you feel bad for missing home already.
-> END
